# Home Lab Documentation

- This repo will simply host documentation for my home lab setup, such as configuration settings and any services that are hosted (on top of those individual service's versions, settings, configs, mappings, etc - obviously minus any unencrypted secrets or sensitive data).
<br>

- This repo will also hold any guides I create for use in my home lab setup based on research done on the topics that are relevant to my setup so that I can reproduce the environment (such as Proxmox setup, Truenas Scale setup, etc... )
<br>

- The services that will be used will also have a boiler-plate style file for kubernetes deployment on Proxmox
<br>

- Each service's configuration files will be annotated with all settings and variables for that service and a README.md will exist in each service's folder explaining the settings used in the lab and how they are configured
<br>

- This repo will also document backup, restore, and snapshot procedures used as well as any replication, pre and post setup procedures, and cron task scripts that are used.
<br>

- The cron task scripts will be boiler-plate scripts that call certain procedures and will be configured for scheduling on the client-side
