# Home Lab Documentation

- This repo will simply host documentation for my home lab setup, such as configuration settings and any services that are hosted (on top of those individual service's versions, settings, configs, mappings, etc - obviously minus any secrets).

- This repo will also document backup, restore, and snapshot procedures used as well as any replication, setup, configuration, and cron task scripts that are used.
